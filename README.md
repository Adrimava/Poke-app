# emof-poke-app
For this project, we will make a Pokemon app! in this app we will have 3 sections, Pokedex, Teams and Trainers. 
<ul>
  <li>Pokedex we will be presented with a paginated list of all pokemons names, and when clicking a name a detailed view will be shown with an image, 
  stats and a pokedex entry from the selected pokemon.</li>
  <li>In Trainers we will be able to create and delete pokemon trainers with name, age, hobby and photo.</li>
  <li>In Teams, we will be able to select a trainer and see their pokemon team and add/remove pokemons to that team. </li>
</ul>
